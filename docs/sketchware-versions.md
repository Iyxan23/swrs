# Sketchware Versions
The field `sketchware_ver` apparently is the sketchware app's version code where the project is created.

> Sadly, I don't know what this is used for. If you do know what it is, please do a pull request or hit up an issue!

## Table
Here is the table that shows sketchware versions based on their version name:
| Version name | `sketchware_ver` value |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| v3.10        | 150                    |
| v3.9.11      | 149                    |

> For modded sketchware versions, I don't know for sure, but I've checked that sketchware pro v6.4.0 beta 6 contains the version code 150. So I guess they don't change the version code at all?
